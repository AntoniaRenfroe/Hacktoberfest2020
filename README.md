# Hacktoberfest2020

Central repository for FasterXML activities related to Hacktoberfest 2020 by DigitalOcean (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

## Contibuting

### General

All FasterXML projects are participating in  [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), so contributions are eligible for the main prizes.

### Indeed + Hactoberfest

In addition to the main event, [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com) is sponsoring additional activities --
see [Indeed Hacktoberfest 2020](https://engineering.indeedblog.com/indeed-hacktoberfest-2020/) for details -- that can net you additional swag: Jackson is one of OSS projects eligible and supported
(being heavily used by Indeed, see [Jackson overview](https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2020/09/jackson-more-than-json-for-java/) at Indeed Engineering Blog).

The only additional requirement is that issues to solve / PRs MUST be labeled with "hacktoberfest"
(if such label is missing you may ask maintainers to check if issue should have it).
