## Design / Content

This folder exists as storage place for contributions to design: images, possibly documents.

Please create a sub-folder with your Github id and add whatever files you want in that folder:
Pull Requests can then be merged to allow review of submissions without merge conflicts.
Merging does not necessarily mean that specific items will be used: we will figure out a
better mechanism for storage; for now this folder acts as a shared scratchpad.
Suggestions for improvement (such as improved structure) welcome!
